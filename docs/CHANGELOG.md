### BREAKING CHANGES

**Circuit Grid Display Mode Removed**
- Calendar block now uses Carousel List as the only display style
- `calendar_display_type` setting removed from Settings Page
- Sites using Circuit Grid will automatically use Carousel List after update

**Removed Files** (~1,300 lines):
- `inc/Blocks/Calendar/DisplayStyles/CircuitGrid/` (entire directory)
  - `CircuitGridRenderer.js` (890 lines) - SVG border rendering, shape calculations
  - `BadgeRenderer.js` (266 lines) - Badge positioning for circuit grid
  - `circuit-grid.css` (~150 lines) - Circuit grid-specific styling
- `inc/Blocks/Calendar/DisplayStyles/ColorManager.js` (76 lines) - Color helper (only used by circuit grid)

### Removed
- **Circuit Grid Display Mode**: Experimental SVG-based display with dynamic borders
  - Complex shape generation (L-shaped cutouts, split groups, connectors)
  - JavaScript-based badge positioning
  - ResizeObserver-based responsive recalculation
  - Grid position calculations and shape generation algorithms
- **Display Type Setting**: `calendar_display_type` removed from admin settings and Settings_Page defaults
