## [0.9.8] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- ICS Calendar Migration to Universal Web Scraper
- WP-CLI Migration Tool for Handler Deprecation
- DoStuff Media API Extractor

Created DoStuffExtractor to parse DoStuff Media JSON feeds (Waterloo Records, Do512, etc.). Extracts complete event data including venue coordinates, pricing, artist information, and image URLs. Handles event_groups structure and normalizes all fields to standard event format.

Created MigrateHandlersCommand WP-CLI tool to migrate flows from deprecated handlers to their replacements. Supports ICS Calendar to Universal Web Scraper migration with dry-run mode for safe testing and automatic configuration field mapping.

Created IcsExtractor to parse raw ICS feed content, supporting Tockify, Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and any standard ICS/iCal feed. Extractor handles timezone detection and venue data extraction from ICS location fields.

### Changed
- Universal Web Scraper Documentation Updates
- Repository Documentation Alignment
- MigrateHandlersCommand Expansion
- MigrateHandlersCommand Eventbrite Support

Expanded migration command to support Eventbrite handler migrations. Added migrateEventbrite() method with 1:1 configuration field mapping from organizer_url to source_url.

Expanded migration command to support DoStuff Media API handler migrations. Added migrateDoStuffMediaApi() method with 1:1 configuration field mapping from feed_url to source_url.

Updated universal-web-scraper-test-command.md with ICS feed support documentation. Added ICS Calendar Feed Support section with examples for Tockify, Google Calendar exports, and migration command usage.

### Deprecated
- ICS Calendar Handler Deprecation
- DoStuff Media API Handler Deprecation
- Eventbrite Handler Deprecation
- Add TimezoneAbilities system with find_broken_timezone_events and fix_event_timezone abilities. EventsHealthCheck now uses abilities as primitives for timezone checking.

Added deprecation notices to Eventbrite handler and settings classes. Existing flows using Eventbrite continue to work but should migrate to Universal Web Scraper using MigrateHandlersCommand. Note: Eventbrite is already handled by JsonLdExtractor in Universal Web Scraper - no new extractor code needed.

Added deprecation notices to DoStuffMediaApi handler and settings classes. Existing flows using DoStuff Media API continue to work but should migrate to Universal Web Scraper using MigrateHandlersCommand.

Added deprecation notices to IcsCalendar handler and settings classes. Existing flows using ICS Calendar continue to work but should migrate to Universal Web Scraper using MigrateHandlersCommand.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- **Universal Web Scraper HTML Fallback Logging**: Updated `DataMachineEvents\Steps\EventImport\Handlers\WebScraper\UniversalWebScraper::extract_raw_html_section()` to log via `ExecutionContext` (and updated the call site), keeping scraper diagnostics consistent during AI HTML fallback extraction.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- **Nullable Job Id Handling**: Updated `DataMachineEvents\Steps\EventImport\EventEngineData::storeVenueContext()` to accept a nullable `$job_id` (`?string`) so handler callers can pass null without triggering a PHP type error; value is still cast to int and ignored when invalid.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-01-08

### Changed
- **ExecutionContext Handler Refactor**: Updated Event Import handlers (`DiceFm`, `DoStuffMediaApi`, `Eventbrite`, `EventFlyer`, `IcsCalendar`, `SingleRecurring`, `Ticketmaster`) and the Universal Web Scraper (`UniversalWebScraper`, `StructuredDataProcessor`, `EventSectionFinder`) to use `ExecutionContext` for logging, processed item tracking, flow/pipeline ids, and engine data storage.
- **Engine Data Storage**: Replaced direct `datamachine_merge_engine_data()` calls with `ExecutionContext::storeEngineData()` in the Ticketmaster handler and structured scraper pipeline.
- **WP-CLI Scraper Flow Id**: Updated `Cli\UniversalWebScraperTestCommand` to use `'direct'` flow id when calling `get_fetch_data()`.

## [0.8.42] - 2026-01-07

### Changed
- **WP-CLI Scraper Test Command Simplification**: Updated `Cli\\UniversalWebScraperTestCommand` to run without job creation or upsert options, generating a `cli_test_*` flow step id internally and focusing output on a single packet’s extraction metadata, event payload shape (structured vs `raw_html`), venue/address coverage warnings, and captured `datamachine_log` warnings.

## [0.8.41] - 2026-01-07

### Added
- **Craftpeak/Arryved Extractor**: Added `Steps\\EventImport\\Handlers\\WebScraper\\Extractors\\CraftpeakExtractor` to extract events from Craftpeak/Arryved "Label" theme sites by parsing `/event/{slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}/` style listings and normalizing title/date/time/image + page-level venue fields.

### Changed
- **Universal Web Scraper Priority**: Updated `UniversalWebScraper` extractor priority to include the Craftpeak/Arryved extractor in the structured extraction pipeline.
- **WP-CLI Scraper Diagnostics**: Enhanced `Cli\\UniversalWebScraperTestCommand` output to report venue/address field coverage (structured vs HTML fallback) and surface warnings when venue metadata is incomplete.

## [0.8.40] - 2026-01-07

### Changed
- **Remove Ticket URL Migration Notice**: Removed `DataMachineEvents\\Admin\\TicketUrlMigration` and its instantiation from `DATAMACHINE_Events::init()` now that the one-time backfill flow is no longer needed.
- **Schema Tool Guidance for Titles**: Updated the AI schema tool parameter description for `Core\\EventSchemaProvider` `title` to emphasize using `original_title` when it is clear, and to rewrite when the scraped title is low quality (ALL CAPS, emojis, dates, formatting).
- **Free Show Price Detection**: Expanded Event Details price CTA logic to treat "no cover" as a non-ticket price alongside "free" and "tbd".
- **Build Output Directory**: Updated `build.sh` to output the packaged plugin into `build/` instead of `dist/`.

## [0.8.39] - 2026-01-07

### Added
- **Ticket URL Indexing Migration**: Added `DataMachineEvents\Admin\TicketUrlMigration`, a one-time admin-triggered migration that backfills `_datamachine_ticket_url` post meta from `datamachine-events/event-details` block `ticketUrl` attributes for existing events.

### Changed
- **Ticket URL Meta Sync**: Event Details block saves now sync a normalized ticket URL into `_datamachine_ticket_url` (query params stripped; trailing slash trimmed) for consistent lookups.
- **Duplicate Detection via Ticket URLs**: `Steps\Upsert\Events\EventUpsert::findExistingEvent()` now checks for existing events by normalized ticket URL + date before falling back to fuzzy/exact title matching.

## [0.8.38] - 2026-01-06

### Changed
- **Music Item Extractor Targeting**: Updated `MusicItemExtractor` to use a strict class token match for `music__item` elements (prevents false positives where `music__item` is a substring of another class).

## [0.8.37] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **Music Item Extractor**: Added `MusicItemExtractor` to the Universal Web Scraper to extract events from `.music__item` / `.music__artist` HTML patterns.

### Changed
- **Update Event Description Storage**: Updated the `UpdateEvent` AI chat tool to write `description` updates into `core/paragraph` InnerBlocks inside the `datamachine-events/event-details` block (instead of treating description as a block attribute).
- **Event Health Check Description Detection**: Updated the `EventHealthCheck` AI chat tool to derive the event description from the Event Details block InnerBlocks (paragraph content) rather than a non-existent `description` attribute.
- **Venue Address Parsing**: Enhanced `PageVenueExtractor::extractStreetAddress()` to better detect real street addresses (supports `610-A` / `123B` patterns and tighter fallback matching) while reducing false positives.
- **Universal Web Scraper Pipeline**: Added `MusicItemExtractor` to the extraction priority list.

## [0.8.36] - 2026-01-06

### Changed
- **Calendar Pagination Boundaries**: Updated calendar pagination so page boundaries respect both minimum day count and minimum event count.
  - `Calendar_Query::get_unique_event_dates()` now returns `events_per_date` and counts events per `Y-m-d` date while building the unique date list.
  - `Calendar_Query::get_date_boundaries_for_page()` now accepts `events_per_date` and constructs variable-length pages that include at least `DAYS_PER_PAGE` (5) dates and at least `MIN_EVENTS_FOR_PAGINATION` (20) events, without splitting a date across pages.
  - The REST calendar controller (`inc/Api/Controllers/Calendar.php`) and calendar block renderer (`inc/blocks/calendar/render.php`) now pass `events_per_date` into `get_date_boundaries_for_page()`.

## [0.8.35] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **Skip Tool Item Context**: Added `EventEngineData::storeItemContext()` and invoked it from `EventImportHandler::markItemProcessed()` so Data Machine's `skip_item` tool can mark AI-skipped items as processed and prevent refetching on subsequent runs.

## [0.8.34] - 2026-01-05

### Changed
- **ICS Calendar Sorting**: Updated `IcsCalendar` handler to explicitly sort events chronologically using `sortEventsWithOrder` with `SORT_ASC` to ensure consistent data processing order.
- **WordPress Extractor Refinement**: Enhanced `WordPressExtractor` to more accurately detect Tribe Events content.
  - Implemented stricter regex matching for Tribe-specific container classes and IDs on content elements (div, section, article, main).
  - Added a `SKIP_DOMAINS` blacklist to prevent extraction from domains with non-functional or broken Tribe installations (e.g., `resoundpresents.com`).
  - Refined fallback endpoint construction to only trigger when actual Tribe container elements are present.

## [0.8.33] - 2026-01-05

### Added
- **AI Chat Tools for Events**: Added `EventHealthCheck` and `UpdateEvent` tools to the AI framework.
